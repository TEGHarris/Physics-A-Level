A stationary wave is actually two waves interfering with one another. It forms when 
- Two progressive waves are travelling in opposite directions
- They have the same frequency
If the waves have the same frequency, sometimes they will be in phase and sometimes in antiphase
## Note : The waves are constantly moving relative to one another so they are only ever in/out of phase at a given point **not** as an entire wave

When the amplitudes cancel out, the displacement of the resultant wave is zero. This is called a **Node** 
When the waves interfere constructively, the amplitude of the resultant wave is at it's maximum. This is called an **Antinode** 

## The separation between two adjacent nodes/antinodes = $\frac {\lambda} {2}$
There is no net energy transfer because the waves are travelling in opposite directions.


All the particles in between two adjacent nodes are in phase with one another. Particles on either side of a node are in antiphase ($\pi \space radians$) 

# Forming a stationary wave using microwaves

Stationary waves can be formed by reflecting microwaves (or other waves, including longitudinal ones) off a surface so that the incoming and reflected waves interfere with one another. Moving a microwave receiver (makes a noise depending on the amplitude of the wave) through the standing wave demonstrates the nodes and antinodes.
